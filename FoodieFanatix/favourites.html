                  <h3>RH Rooftop Restaurant - New York</h3>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    RH is named for the fancy furniture store it’s on top of,
                    and if you’re unfamiliar with Restoration Hardware, it’s
                    worth coming here just to walk around and check out couches
                    that cost as much as cars. The menu isn’t super exciting,
                    but they deliver a perfect burrata with grilled tomatoes and
                    a great ribeye sandwich. There’s no hard liquor here, which
                    should be your first indication this isn’t a typical rooftop
                    party restaurant. (Your second indication is that RH closes
                    at 9pm.) Still, this is a good option for fun group dinners
                    when you want to get dressed up and experience amazing
                    views.
